# landing-page
creating an entire webpage via the odin project

I'm excited to layout an entire page on my own, and also really looking forward to moving on with Javascript, but I am making it a point to not rush through this section so I can have a full grasp of the content. I will be updating this README after completion and give some thoughts on how it went for me, and any hiccups I may encounter along the way.
